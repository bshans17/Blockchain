# Blockchain
## Was able to complete the following: 
1. Created Accounts for two nodes
2. Ran puppeth and created a new genesis block. 
3. Chose the POA consensus algorithm. 
4. Created the network JSON (screenshot is here)
5. Successfully initialized each node. 
6. Ran the first node, opened a second bash window and ran the second. 

At this point I ran into issues. I had problems connecting to the Kovan network with MyCrypto wallet. I wanted to continue working on this as I think I am pretty close 
and the steps are straightforward. I wanted to have something submitted by the due date, but will be attending office hours to finish up and hope to be able to submit the 
rest of the assignment to at least get partial credit.
